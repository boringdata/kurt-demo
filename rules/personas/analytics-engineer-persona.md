## Preferred Communication Style

### What Resonates

**Tone:** Technical, direct, respectful of their expertise

**Content Preferences:**
- **Precise over vague:** Exact commands, not hand-waving
- **Technical over simplified:** Show me the details
- **Practical over theoretical:** How do I actually do this?
- **Fast over comprehensive:** Get me started quickly, link to full docs

**Language Patterns:**
✅ **Effective:**
- "Run `dbtf --version` to verify installation"
- "The Fusion engine parses projects up to 30x faster"
- "This prevents unnecessary warehouse compute"
- "Compatible with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Simply run the installation" (dismisses complexity)
- "Obviously you'll want to..." (condescending)
- "Just use this amazing feature!" (overhyped)
- "Contact sales for more information" (in technical docs)
