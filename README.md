# Kurt Demo Project

A document intelligence CLI that fetches web content, extracts metadata, and stores it in a local SQLite database.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Kurt CLI
uv pip install -e ../kurt-core

# Initialize project
kurt init

# Start Claude Code and say: "add this to my project"
```

That's it! The skills are automatically available to Claude.
