# List Rule Types Subskill

**Purpose:** Display all rule types (built-in + custom) with their status
**Parent Skill:** writing-rules-skill
**Operation:** Management

---

## Context Received from Parent Skill

- `$REGISTRY_PATH` - `/rules/rules-config.yaml`
- `$RULES_BASE_DIR` - `/rules/`

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Load Rules Registry

```bash
# Load rules-config.yaml
registry_file="/rules/rules-config.yaml"

if [ ! -f "$registry_file" ]; then
  error "Rules registry not found at $registry_file"
  echo "Run 'writing-rules-skill validate' to check setup."
  exit 1
fi

# Parse YAML to get all rule types
```

### Step 2: Categorize Rule Types

For each rule type in registry:
- Check if built_in (true/false)
- Check if enabled (true/false)
- Check extraction status (count rule files in directory)

**Categories:**
1. Built-in rule types (enabled)
2. Custom rule types (enabled)
3. Disabled rule types (built-in or custom)

### Step 3: Count Extracted Rules

For each enabled rule type:
```bash
rule_directory="/rules/{directory}/"

if [ -d "$rule_directory" ]; then
  # Count markdown files (exclude README if present)
  count=$(find "$rule_directory" -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" | wc -l)
else
  count=0
fi
```

### Step 4: Display Formatted Output
