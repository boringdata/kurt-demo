# Show Rule Type Details Subskill

**Purpose:** Display comprehensive information about a specific rule type
**Parent Skill:** writing-rules-skill
**Operation:** Management

---

## Context Received from Parent Skill

- `$REGISTRY_PATH` - `/rules/rules-config.yaml`
- `$RULES_BASE_DIR` - `/rules/`
- `$ARGUMENTS` - Should contain rule type name

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Arguments

Extract rule type name from arguments:
```bash
rule_type_name="$1"

if [ -z "$rule_type_name" ]; then
  error "Rule type name required"
  echo "Usage: writing-rules-skill show <rule-type-name>"
  echo "Example: writing-rules-skill show verticals"
  echo ""
  echo "To see all rule types: writing-rules-skill list"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2: Load Registry and Validate

```bash
# Load rules-config.yaml
registry_file="/rules/rules-config.yaml"

if [ ! -f "$registry_file" ]; then
  error "Rules registry not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if rule type exists in registry
# Parse YAML to find rule_types[$rule_type_name]
```

**If rule type not found:**
```
Error: Rule type '$rule_type_name' not found in registry

Available rule types:
  - style
  - structure
  - persona
  - publisher
  - verticals
  - use-cases

To see all details: writing-rules-skill list
```

### Step 3: Load Rule Type Configuration

Extract all fields for this rule type:
- name (display name)
- description
- directory
- enabled (true/false)
- built_in (true/false)
- multiple_files (true/false)
- required_by_default (true/false)
- extracts (list)
- governs (list)
- source_patterns (list)
- extraction config (subskill, discovery_modes, sample_size, instructions)
- validation config

### Step 4: Check Extraction Status

```bash
rule_directory="/rules/${directory}/"

# Count extracted rules
if [ -d "$rule_directory" ]; then
  extracted_files=$(find "$rule_directory" -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md")
  count=$(echo "$extracted_files" | wc -l)

  # For each file, get metadata:
  # - File name
  # - Number of documents analyzed (from YAML frontmatter)
  # - Extraction date (from YAML frontmatter)
else
  count=0
  extracted_files=""
fi
```

### Step 5: Check for Conflicts

Read conflict_rules from registry:
- Find any rules that mention this rule type
- Extract conflict messages

### Step 6: Display Comprehensive Information
