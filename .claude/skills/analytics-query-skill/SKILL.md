# Analytics Query Skill

## Overview

This skill provides **low-level, ad-hoc analytics queries** for quick traffic analysis. Use this skill when users ask simple questions about page traffic, trends, or want to spot-check specific pages.

**Key principle:** This is a **utility skill** - it wraps `kurt content list` and `kurt content stats` commands with analytics filters. It can be used directly by users OR called by higher-level skills like `content-analysis-skill`.

---

## When to Use This Skill

‚úÖ **Use analytics-query-skill when:**
- User asks simple traffic questions: "Which pages get the most traffic?"
- Spot-checking specific pages: "How's the traffic for the BigQuery tutorial?"
- Identifying trends: "What's losing traffic?"
- User wants quick analytics summary: "Show me traffic stats for docs.company.com"

‚ùå **Don't use analytics-query-skill when:**
- Complex workflows (Tutorial Refresh, Documentation Audit) ‚Üí Use `content-analysis-skill`
- Need traffic-based prioritization across many pages ‚Üí Use `content-analysis-skill identify-affected`
- Need impact estimation or gap analysis ‚Üí Use `content-analysis-skill`

**Rule of thumb:** If it's a single analytics query or spot-check, use this skill. If it's part of a larger content workflow, use `content-analysis-skill` (which may call this skill internally).

## Operations

### 1. `top <N> [--metric pageviews_30d] [--url-prefix <domain>]`

**Purpose:** Show top N pages by traffic metric

**Implementation:**
```bash
kurt content list \
  --with-analytics \
  --order-by pageviews_30d \
  --limit <N> \
  ${url_prefix:+--url-starts-with $url_prefix}
```

**Example usage:**
```
User: Show me the top 10 pages by traffic

Claude (invokes analytics-query top 10):

...

User: What about just docs.company.com?

Claude (invokes analytics-query top 10 --url-prefix https://docs.company.com):

Top 10 Pages on docs.company.com (last 30 days):
[filtered results]
```

**Supported metrics:**

---

### 2. `bottom <N> [--metric pageviews_30d] [--url-prefix <domain>]`

**Purpose:** Show bottom N pages by traffic metric (lowest traffic)

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Get traffic stats first to find threshold
kurt content stats --show-analytics ${url_prefix:+--url-starts-with $url_prefix}

# Then filter for low traffic + sort ascending
kurt content list \
  --with-analytics \
  --pageviews-30d-max ${p25_threshold} \

---

## Implementation Details

### Getting Traffic Thresholds

All operations that categorize by traffic (ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) should:

1. **Get thresholds from stats:**
```bash
stats=$(kurt content stats --show-analytics --url-starts-with <domain> --format json)
p25=$(echo "$stats" | jq '.p25_pageviews_30d')
p75=$(echo "$stats" | jq '.p75_pageviews_30d')
```

2. **Categorize results:**
- ZERO: pageviews_30d == 0
- LOW: 0 < pageviews_30d <= p25
- MEDIUM: p25 < pageviews_30d <= p75
- HIGH: pageviews_30d > p75

3. **Present grouped results:**
Show highest priority first (ZERO > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW or reverse depending on context).

### Conversational Presentation

**Always provide:**
- Clear category labels (ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH with thresholds explained)
- Traffic trend symbols (‚Üë ‚Üì ‚Üí) with percentages
- Contextual recommendations based on results
- Tips for next steps

**Example good presentation:**
```
Found 23 tutorials:

ZERO TRAFFIC (0 views): 2 tutorials
‚ö†Ô∏è These pages may be orphaned or deprecated
- "Advanced BigQuery ML" (0 views, 950 days old)
- Consider: Archive or improve discoverability?

HIGH TRAFFIC (>890 views): 6 tutorials
üéØ Focus here for maximum impact
1. "Python SDK Guide" (2,103 views, ‚Üì -8%) ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT
   ‚Üí Losing traffic - needs refresh

Recommendation: Start with Python SDK Guide (high traffic + declining = urgent + high impact)
```

---

## Integration with Other Skills

### Called BY content-analysis-skill

`content-analysis-skill` uses this skill for individual queries:

```python
# content-analysis-skill: identify-affected operation

# Step 1: Find matching content
matching_docs = search_content(term, content_type)

# Step 2: Get traffic data using analytics-query-skill
traffic_data = analytics_query.traffic_for(term)

# Step 3: Apply workflow-specific prioritization logic
prioritized = prioritize_by_urgency(matching_docs, traffic_data)
```

### Used DIRECTLY by user

User can invoke directly for ad-hoc queries without a workflow context.

## Error Handling

### Analytics not configured

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics not configured for this domain

To enable analytics:
1. Run: kurt analytics onboard <domain>
2. Provide PostHog credentials
3. Sync data: kurt analytics sync <domain>

Proceeding with results (no traffic data shown)...
```

### Analytics data stale

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Analytics data is 10 days old

For accurate results, sync now:
kurt analytics sync <domain>

Sync now? (Y/n)
```

### No results found

```
No documents found matching "<pattern>"

Try:
- Broader search term
- Check spelling
- Check if content is fetched: kurt content list --url-contains "<term>"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Low-level utility** - Simple, composable operations
2. **Wraps CLI commands** - No complex logic, just intelligent presentation
3. **Used by humans and skills** - API-like interface + conversational output
4. **Traffic-aware presentation** - Always show traffic context (ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
5. **Actionable recommendations** - Suggest next steps based on results
