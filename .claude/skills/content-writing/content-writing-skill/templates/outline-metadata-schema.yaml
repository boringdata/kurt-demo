# Section-Source Mapping
sections:

    patterns: [list of pattern IDs, or [] if none]
    reasoning: "[why this section is structured this way]"

# USAGE NOTES:
#
# STREAMLINED VERSION - removed bloat:
# ❌ Removed: word_count per section (too granular, always changes)
# ❌ Removed: planned_compliance (aspirational, not actual lineage)
# ❌ Removed: content_depth, target_audience (redundant with persona)
# ❌ Removed: style_voice details (already in style guide file)
#
# WHAT REMAINS (the useful parts):
# ✅ Basic identity and context
# ✅ Rules that will be applied
# ✅ Source documents with purposes
# ✅ Update patterns (if project-specific)
# ✅ Objective and success metric
# ✅ Section-to-source mapping with reasoning
#
# Key principle: Keep metadata that's ACTIONABLE and QUERYABLE
# Remove metadata that's SUBJECTIVE or REDUNDANT
