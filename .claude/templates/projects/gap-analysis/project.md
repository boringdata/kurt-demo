# Gap Analysis Project Template

## Goal

Identify content gaps by comparing our documentation against [COMPETITOR] to find topics they cover that we don't. Prioritize gaps by traffic opportunity and strategic value.

**Before using:** ✓ Competitor content must be indexed

## Intent Category

**Content Type:** Analysis / Strategy
**Primary Goal:** Identify high-value content gaps to fill
**Audience:** Internal (content strategy planning)

## Competitor Context

**Analyzing:** [COMPETITOR_DOMAIN]
**Analysis type:** Gap analysis
**Last analyzed:** [DATE]

**Comparison focus:**
- Missing topics (they have, we don't)
- Content type gaps (tutorials, guides, examples)
- Strategic value assessment

## Sources (Ground Truth)

### From Organizational Knowledge Base

*Our existing content:*
- /sources/[our-domain]/

### Project-Specific Sources

*Competitor content:*
- /sources/[competitor-domain]/ (must be indexed first)

*Add to project:*
- Customer requests for documentation
- Keyword research data
- Support ticket topics

## Targets (Content to Update/Create)

### Content Gaps Identified

**HIGH Priority Gaps** (Strategic + High opportunity)
- [ ] [Topic 1] - Why important: [Core feature, customer requests]
  - Competitor has: /competitor/path
  - We need: [Tutorial, reference, guide]
  - Estimated opportunity: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

- [ ] [Topic 2] - Why important: [Reason]
  - Competitor has: /competitor/path
  - We need: [Content type]
  - Estimated opportunity: [Traffic potential]

**MEDIUM Priority Gaps** (Good opportunity)
- [ ] [Topic 3] - Why important: [Reason]

**LOW Priority Gaps** (Nice to have)
- [ ] [Topic 4] - Why important: [Reason]

### New Content to Create

*Follow-up deliverable:*
- Gap analysis report (this project.md)
- Prioritized content roadmap
- Individual projects for top 3-5 gaps

## Rules Configuration

### Style
- Use rules/style/[appropriate-voice].md

### Structure
- Use rules/structure/[appropriate-type].md

### Personas
- Use rules/personas/ matching the topic

### Publisher Profile
- Use rules/publisher/publisher-profile.md

## Progress

- [ ] Competitor content indexed
- [ ] Topic clusters identified
- [ ] Gaps identified and categorized
- [ ] Traffic opportunity estimated
- [ ] Strategic value assessed
- [ ] Gaps prioritized
- [ ] Content roadmap created
- [ ] Follow-up projects created for top gaps

## Next Steps

**Workflow:**

1. **Prerequisites** - Index competitor content, get analytics baseline

2. **Identify Gaps** (3-4 hours)
   - Review competitor topic clusters
   - Check if we have equivalent for each
   - List topics competitor has that we don't
   - Group by content type

3. **Estimate Impact** (2-3 hours)
   - For each gap, estimate opportunity:
     - Check search volume (if available)
     - Consider strategic importance
   - Categorize: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

4. **Prioritize** (1-2 hours)
   - Score on two dimensions:
     - Strategic value (core product feature?)
     - Traffic opportunity (high search volume?)
   - HIGH = Strategic + High traffic
   - MEDIUM = Either strategic OR high traffic
   - LOW = Neither (but worth considering)

5. **Create Plan** (1 hour)
   - Select top 3-5 gaps to fill
   - Define content type needed for each
   - Create timeline
   - Create individual projects

6. **Execute** - Create gap-filling content, track performance

---

**Prioritization Matrix:**
- Strategic + High Traffic = 🔴 CRITICAL (do first)
- Strategic + Med Traffic = 🟡 HIGH
- Nice to have + High Traffic = 🟡 HIGH
- All others = 🔵 MEDIUM or ⚪ LOW

---

**To use this template:**
1. Clone with `/clone-project gap-analysis`
2. Index competitor content first
3. Run gap identification
4. Fill in Targets section with found gaps
5. Prioritize using matrix above
6. Create follow-up projects for top 3-5 gaps
