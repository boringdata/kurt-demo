# Competitive Analysis Project Template

## Goal

Compare our documentation coverage and quality against [COMPETITOR] across shared topics. Identify where we're weaker and create improvement plan.

**Before using:** ✓ Both our and competitor content must be indexed

## Intent Category

**Content Type:** Analysis / Quality Benchmark
**Primary Goal:** Identify quality gaps and improvement opportunities
**Audience:** Internal (content planning)

## Competitor Context

**Analyzing:** [COMPETITOR_DOMAIN]
**Analysis type:** Comprehensive competitive analysis
**Last analyzed:** [DATE]

**Comparison focus:**
- Quality benchmarking (depth, examples, visuals)
- Structure and organization
- Topic coverage completeness

## Sources (Ground Truth)

### From Organizational Knowledge Base

*Our content for comparison:*
- /sources/[our-domain]/

### Project-Specific Sources

*Competitor content:*
- /sources/[competitor-domain]/ (must be indexed first)

*Add to project:*
- Competitor analysis notes
- User feedback comparing docs
- Support ticket data

## Targets (Content to Update/Create)

### Quality Gaps Identified

**CRITICAL Improvements** (High-traffic topics where we're weaker)
- [ ] [Topic 1] - Why they're better: [More examples, better structure, etc.]
  - Our page: /our-domain/path
  - Their page: /competitor-domain/path
  - Gap: [Specific improvements needed]

**HIGH Priority Improvements** (Important topics, quality gap)
- [ ] [Topic 2] - Why they're better: [Reason]
  - Our page: [path]
  - Their page: [path]
  - Gap: [Improvements needed]

**MEDIUM Priority** (Less critical or smaller gaps)
- [ ] [Topic 3] - Minor improvements: [Reason]

### Our Strengths (No action needed)

*Topics where we're already competitive or better:*
- ✅ [Topic X] - We have better examples
- ✅ [Topic Y] - Our structure is clearer

### Existing Content to Update

*Pages to improve (from CRITICAL/HIGH above):*
- [ ] /our-domain/topic1 - Add: [3 more examples, diagram, restructure intro]
- [ ] /our-domain/topic2 - Add: [troubleshooting section, update code]

### New Content to Create

*Analysis deliverable:*
- Competitive analysis report (this project.md)
- Quality improvement roadmap

## Rules Configuration

### Style
- Use rules/style/technical-docs.md
- Maintain our voice (don't copy competitor's style)

### Structure
- Use rules/structure/[appropriate-type].md
- Learn from competitor's structure

### Personas
- Use rules/personas/ for our audience

### Publisher Profile
- Use rules/publisher/publisher-profile.md

## Progress

- [ ] Both our and competitor content indexed
- [ ] Shared topics identified
- [ ] Quality comparison completed
- [ ] Gaps categorized by priority
- [ ] Improvement roadmap created
- [ ] Top 3-5 improvement projects created

## Next Steps

**Workflow:**

1. **Prerequisites** - Index both content sets, get analytics for prioritization

2. **Coverage Analysis** (2-3 hours)
   - List all topics competitor covers
   - Check which ones we also cover
   - Focus on: Shared topics where we might be weaker

3. **Quality Comparison** (4-6 hours)
   - For each shared topic, compare:
     - Breadth (subtopics covered)
     - Depth (detail level)
     - Examples (code quality/quantity)
     - Visuals (diagrams, screenshots)
     - Structure (organization clarity)
   - Rate: ✅ We're better | 🟡 Equal | ❌ They're better

4. **Prioritize** (1-2 hours)
   - Focus on: ❌ They're better
   - CRITICAL = High traffic + They're better
   - HIGH = Medium traffic + They're better

5. **Create Plan** (1 hour)
   - Define specific improvements for top 3-5 weak topics
   - Create timeline and effort estimates

6. **Execute** - Implement improvements, track results
