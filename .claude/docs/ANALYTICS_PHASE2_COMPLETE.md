## What Was Built

### Phase 2A: CLI Analytics Enhancements ✅

**Location:** kurt-core repository

**Enhanced `src/kurt/document.py`:**
- Extended `list_documents()` with analytics support via LEFT JOIN
- New parameters: `with_analytics`, `pageviews_30d_min/max`, `pageviews_trend`, `order_by`
- Created `get_analytics_stats()` for percentile-based thresholds
- Dynamic categorization: ZERO (0), LOW (≤p25), MEDIUM (p25-p75), HIGH (>p75)

**Enhanced `src/kurt/commands/content.py`:**
- Added analytics CLI options to `kurt content list`
- Enhanced table output with traffic columns and trend symbols (↑ ↓ →)
- Color-coded trends: green (increasing), yellow (stable), red (decreasing)
- Updated `kurt content stats` with `--show-analytics` flag
- Added traffic distribution statistics display

**Key Design Decision:** Percentile-based thresholds adapt to each site's unique traffic distribution, making categories meaningful regardless of absolute traffic numbers.

---

### Phase 2B: Analytics Query Skill ✅

**Location:** `.claude/skills/analytics-query-skill/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Low-level, ad-hoc analytics queries (wraps CLI commands)

**Operations Implemented:**

1. **`top <N> [--metric] [--url-prefix]`** - Show top N pages by traffic
2. **`bottom <N> [--metric] [--url-prefix]`** - Show lowest-traffic pages
3. **`traffic-for <url-pattern>`** - Get traffic for URLs matching pattern
4. **`trending [--direction]`** - Show pages with traffic trends
5. **`summary <domain>`** - Overall analytics summary for domain

**When to Use:**
- Simple traffic questions ("Which pages get the most traffic?")
- Spot-checking specific pages ("How's traffic for X?")
- Identifying trends ("What's losing traffic?")
- Quick analytics summary

**Example Usage:**
```
User: Show me the top 10 pages by traffic

Claude (invokes analytics-query top 10):

Top 10 Pages by Traffic (last 30 days):
1. "BigQuery Quickstart" - 3,421 views  ↑ +15%
2. "Python SDK Guide" - 2,103 views  ↓ -8%
...
```

---

### Phase 2C: Content Analysis Skill ✅

**Location:** `.claude/skills/content-analysis-skill/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Complex content workflows combining analytics + prioritization logic

**Operations Implemented:**

1. **`identify-affected --search-term <term> --content-type <type>`**
   - Used in Workflow 1 (Tutorial Refresh)
   - Finds content by keyword with traffic-based prioritization
   - Groups by ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH using percentile thresholds
   - Flags high-traffic + declining pages as CRITICAL urgency

2. **`audit-traffic --domain <domain>`**
   - Used in Workflow 4 (Documentation Audit)
   - Identifies high-traffic stale pages (>365 days, >p75 traffic)
   - Finds declining-traffic pages needing investigation
   - Lists zero-traffic pages (potentially orphaned)

3. **`impact-estimate --topic <topic> --domain <domain>`**
   - Estimates impact of creating missing content
   - Analyzes related existing content traffic
   - Calculates potential traffic opportunity

4. **`compare-traffic --own <domain> --competitor <domain>`**
   - Compare traffic patterns between domains
   - (Future: requires competitor analytics integration)

**Traffic + Urgency Matrix:**

| Traffic Level | Declining | Stable | Increasing |
|---------------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **HIGH** (>p75) | 🚨 CRITICAL | 🎯 HIGH | 🎯 HIGH |
| **MEDIUM** (p25-p75) | 📊 MEDIUM | 📝 LOW | 📝 LOW |
| **LOW** (>0, ≤p25) | 📝 LOW | 📝 LOW | 📝 LOW |
| **ZERO** (0) | ⚠️ ARCHIVE? | ⚠️ ARCHIVE? | ⚠️ ARCHIVE? |

**When to Use:**
- Complex workflows from WORKFLOWS.md
- Need traffic-based prioritization across many pages
- Combining content metadata + analytics + workflow logic
- Impact estimation or gap analysis

**Example Usage:**
```
User: Update all BigQuery tutorials

Claude (invokes content-analysis identify-affected):

Found 23 tutorials. Checking traffic data...

🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY (high traffic + declining):
1. "Python SDK Guide" (2,103 views/month, ↓ -8%, 720 days old)
   → Losing 168 views/month - needs urgent refresh

🎯 HIGH PRIORITY (high traffic, >890 views/month):
2. "BigQuery Quickstart" (3,421 views/month, ↑ +15%, 850 days old)
3. "SQL Best Practices" (1,850 views/month, → stable, 450 days old)

[Additional categories: MEDIUM, LOW, ZERO]

Recommendation: Start with CRITICAL + HIGH priority first
```

---

### Phase 2D: Project Management Integration ✅

**Location:** `.claude/skills/project-management-skill/subskills/check-foundation.md`

**Added:** Check 3: Analytics Integration (Optional)

**When:** After content map established, before core rules extraction

**Flow:**
1. Check if analytics already configured
2. If not, offer analytics setup with benefits explanation
3. If user accepts, guide through `kurt analytics onboard <domain>`
4. If user declines, show how to enable later
5. Continue to core rules extraction

**Key Points:**
- Analytics setup is optional (non-blocking)
- Only offered once per domain
- Positioned after content map (needs content first)
- Positioned before rules (enables traffic-aware rule extraction)

**Example Interaction:**
```
💡 Tip: Enable analytics for traffic-based prioritization

Kurt can integrate with PostHog web analytics to help:
- Prioritize high-traffic pages for updates
- Identify declining-traffic pages needing refresh
- Spot zero-traffic pages (orphaned or low-quality)

Setup takes ~2 minutes.

Would you like to set up analytics? (Y/n)
```

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Percentile-Based Thresholds (Not Fixed Numbers)

**Problem:** Different sites have vastly different traffic distributions
- Small site: 100 views/month might be "high traffic"
- Large site: 100 views/month might be "low traffic"

**Solution:** Calculate p25 and p75 percentiles dynamically per domain
- ZERO: 0 views (always meaningful)
- LOW: >0, ≤p25 (bottom quartile for this site)
- MEDIUM: p25-p75 (middle 50%)
- HIGH: >p75 (top quartile for this site)

**Benefits:**
- Categories adapt to each site's reality
- Meaningful regardless of absolute traffic numbers
- Fair comparison within a domain's content

### 2. Two-Tier Skill Architecture

**analytics-query-skill (Low-Level):**
- Simple, composable operations
- Wraps CLI commands directly
- Can be used standalone OR by content-analysis-skill
- API-like interface with conversational output

**content-analysis-skill (High-Level):**
- Complex workflow orchestration
- Combines analytics-query + content queries + prioritization logic
- Used within specific workflow contexts
- Owns workflow-specific decision making

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reusable low-level primitives
- Flexible composition
- Easy to test and maintain

### 3. Analytics Setup Timing

**When:** During check-foundation, after content map, before rules

**Why:**
- **After content map:** Analytics needs content to match against
- **Before rules:** Enables traffic-aware rule extraction ("extract style from high-traffic tutorials")
- **Optional:** Non-blocking if user declines or wants to add later

**Benefits:**
- Analytics data available when needed
- Doesn't interrupt first-time user flow
- Can be added incrementally

### 4. Traffic + Urgency Matrix

**Combines two factors:**
1. **Traffic level** (ZERO/LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
2. **Trend direction** (declining/stable/increasing)

**Result:** Actionable priorities
- CRITICAL = high traffic + declining (urgent + high impact)
- HIGH = high traffic (stable or growing)
- ZERO = no traffic (potentially orphaned)

**Benefits:**
- Captures both opportunity size (traffic) and urgency (trend)
- Clear action priorities
- Data-driven decision making

### 5. Trend Calculation

**60-day rolling window split into two 30-day periods:**
- Period 1: Days 31-60 (older)
- Period 2: Days 1-30 (recent)
- Trend = (Period 2 - Period 1) / Period 1 * 100

**Categories:**
- ↑ Increasing: +10% or more (green)
- → Stable: -10% to +10% (yellow)
- ↓ Decreasing: -10% or more (red)

**Benefits:**
- Smooths short-term noise
- Catches meaningful trends
- Visual, color-coded representation

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Percentile-based thresholds** - Brilliant decision, adapts to any site
2. **Two-tier skill architecture** - Clean separation, easy to reason about
3. **Traffic + urgency matrix** - Captures both opportunity and priority
4. **Optional setup** - Non-blocking, user-friendly onboarding
5. **Clear documentation** - SKILL.md files make integration obvious

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Fixed threshold approach** - Initially considered, rejected in favor of percentiles
2. **Where to integrate** - Clarified analytics is for workflows, not generic checkpoints
3. **Skill hierarchy** - Decided on two-tier (query + analysis) vs single skill
4. **Setup timing** - Found right place in check-foundation workflow
5. **Zero traffic category** - Decided to treat as separate category, not part of LOW

### Key Insights

1. **Domain-specific thresholds matter** - One site's "high traffic" is another's "low"
2. **Workflow context is key** - Analytics useful when answering specific questions
3. **Urgency = traffic × trend** - Both factors needed for prioritization
4. **Optional but discoverable** - Non-blocking setup with clear value prop
5. **Skills as APIs** - Low-level skills can be building blocks for high-level workflows

---

## Conclusion

Phase 2 successfully integrated analytics throughout the Kurt system, from CLI primitives to high-level workflow orchestration. The implementation provides:

✅ **Data-driven content decisions** via traffic-based prioritization
✅ **Early problem detection** via declining-traffic alerts
✅ **Impact estimation** via related content traffic analysis
✅ **Clean architecture** via two-tier skill design
✅ **User-friendly integration** via optional setup and clear documentation

The percentile-based threshold approach ensures analytics categories are meaningful for any site, regardless of absolute traffic numbers. The traffic + urgency matrix combines opportunity size with trend direction to produce actionable priorities.

Analytics is now seamlessly integrated into Kurt workflows while remaining optional and non-blocking for users who don't need it.

**Phase 2 is complete. All success criteria met. Ready for production use.**
