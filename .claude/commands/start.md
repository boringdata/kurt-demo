# Start: Team Onboarding

This command runs the one-time team onboarding process.

Use the Skill tool to invoke:

```
onboarding-skill
```

The skill will guide you through:
1. Capturing team context (company, goals, content types, personas)
2. Mapping content sources (website, docs, research)
3. Setting up analytics (optional)
4. Extracting foundation rules (publisher, style, personas)
5. Creating your team profile (.kurt/profile.md)

All orchestration logic lives in the skill. See `.claude/skills/onboarding-skill/SKILL.md` for details.
